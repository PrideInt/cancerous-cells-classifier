# Cancerous Cells Classifier and Metastasis Predictor
Running naive Bayes and support vector machine classifiers using scikit-learn on benign/malignant cancer cell data sets to predict metastasis.
- **Pride Y**.

> ## IN DEVELOPMENT

## Classifier

This program rudimentally classifies cancer cell data on benignity and malignancy from scikit-learn's 
existing breast cancer data set using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers. (*In development*)

We will train the data, then run it through a confusion matrix to identify the correctness of our data
for both classifiers.

## Predictor

This program attempts to predict the metastatic growth of cancer cells based on the results
provided from our classification above. (*In development*)

## Dependencies

### scikit-learn
```js
pip install scikit-learn
```
